How to get partime work
- you have to have tact when approaching the subject
- for example: compromising salary
- you will get my best hours and pay me proportionally less
- more resistance at bigger companies
- VPD: works 4 days a week
  - job share with an intermediate
- don't ask for it before they know they want you, but before they hire you.
- Contracting? some companies will find the jobs and you take them.
- Consulting?

Ask Tam about working with codecore? apparently these places are always looking for instructors

Progressional models in software? Deliberate practice. Pluralsite?

Become deeply knowledgeable about something (like cypress or e2e testing for example) and that gives you something you can leverage

Make the constraint that you cannot CODE during your first month.
